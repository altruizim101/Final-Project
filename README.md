# -- Final Capstone Project -- 

## Title: Precision Agriculture & Crop Recommendations.

### Data Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset/data]
### Data Summary:
[Kaggle] ... "Recommendations from evaluation of this dataset with Machine Learning techniques will aid farmers in making informed decisions in their farming strategy. 
This dataset allows the users to build a predictive model to aid in recommendations for suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters."

## Proposal -

- Research question I expect to answer (in one sentence, if possible) : Are farmers better off using recommendations based on our analysis applying ML tecchniques?
- Expected data source(s): [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset/data]

- Techniques expected to use in analysis
- Expected results: Presented through data visualization, models used for evaluations, accuracy of models, correlation driving recommendations.
- Why this question is important: a) water and land are critical resources b) supports sustainable farming and minimizes application of chemicals,
  which are generally bad for the environment c) optimizes the production of crops based on nutritional needs. Overall, contribute to a healthy
population one nutritional crop at a time.

## Goal -
The goal of this exercise is to succesfully apply the AI/ML concepts and ML technicques acquired in this program to build 
predictive model to aid in recommendations for suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

   
## Deliverables
The final submission should include the Jupyter Notebook and other relevant files, such as the dataset provided and uploaded to a GitHub repository.

## (Data Understanding)
Checked for possible Null (NaN) values in data for removal before analysis. Then filtered NaN data as appropriate.
Action: removed missing (NaN) data in columns
